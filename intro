I was browsing Reddit one evening and found a post for SNES data.

I figured this would be a good piece of data to explore basic SQL and data.

You can ask many questions to research SNES games. The exercise can be applied to many other scenarios when doing basic research.

The idea behind this exercise is it stimulates research by researching top lists from the data. 
It can encourage you to look at the history of game consoles and see the state of gaming today. Which games are popular?
