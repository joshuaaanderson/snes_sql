I was browsing Reddit one evening and found a post for SNES data.

I figured this would be a good piece of data to explore basic SQL and data.

You can ask many questions to research SNES games. The exercise can be applied to many other scenarios when doing basic research.

The idea behind this exercise is it stimulates research by researching top lists from the data. 
It can encourage you to look at the history of game consoles and see the state of gaming today. Which games are popular? 

The database I used was Postgres 15 w/ PG Admin.

This is to give educators or people interested in stimulating their thinking ideas.

This can be combined with work on using spreadsheets to generate graphs for quantiative reasoning exercises.

There is a capstoneSQL file. This file lets you take a peak into a couple of advanced functions in PostgresSQL that is used to parse string text.

There, you can look at the words in a title and find the most published games with a particular word in the title.

This is important and can be a gateway about thinking about information.

[FILES]

1. all_snes_titles.sql (SQL Table)
2. SNES Games.csv (Game data to import into PostgresSQL)
3. basic_sql_questions_for_data.sql (example questions to ask the data)
4. Example Graphics - Sheet1.pdf (Chart one of the queries to look presentable using google sheets)
5. capstoneSQL.sql (File used to further explorer game title names)

[SUGGESTIONS]
1. Students could create their fake office data and sales data (tables) to generate information to explorer left joins, right joins, and unions.
